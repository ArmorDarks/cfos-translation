So the server, as it is often a single instance should do as little as possible. The main functions are controlling legitimate access to resources and keeping consistent state. For example the client's browser requests data, sorts, prepares and displays it to the user without the server's help. The server's role is only to keep the data in a consistent state.

However, it leads to problems on media with highly varying ping times, like wireless mobile connections (UMTS, WiMAX, CDMA, CDMA 2000, etc). A temporary increase in ping time will cause cFosSpeed to reduce its sending or receiving speed, even if such a spike in ping time might not be caused by a clogged line. Thus, the maximum speed might not be reached and cFosSpeed can not use all available bandwidth.";
ts_ts_24 = "As a solution, cFosSpeed now conducts statistical analysis of ping times over a relative long time period to determine the normal ping time of the connection and the typical deviation from it. This statistical data are dynamically adjusted, so changes in bandwidth or latency are detected and properly reflected. This improves transmission speeds on mobile connections, but also increases responsiveness slightly on DSL or cable connections.";
ts_ts_25 = "This statistical analysis works fine as long as cFosSpeed can be sure that changes in measured ping times reflect the normal behaviour of the medium.
